Marooned on an island full of dinosaurs 

Set in the 1700s in the Caribbean. Some one marooned you on purpose. You lost your memory? 
Trapped on an island lost to time. Find a treasure chest with a gun in it. Add a sword at some point. 
Need a way of making structures like lost temple ruins. caves. Huts. villagers? hostile locals? Go full Turok? 
Need to keep the scope small enough to finish. It's already hugely complicated. 

Level switching. Change heightmaps from a menu, destroy all objects, regenerate vegetation, and raptors.

Terrain has a hard limit to how big it can be. 4k textures scaled to 16k. sounds like a lot but everything is scaled big. Need serpanteen paths that loop around. Need a way to block player besides water. invisible walls where thick jungle is. Create bounding boxes around trees. make areas where trees are too dense to pass. 

invisible wall at the edge of water plane. make a boundary at 30k radius from center for all maps?
